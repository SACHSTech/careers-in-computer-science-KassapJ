# Valuable Experiential Learning Opportunities
| Low-Level                             | Mid-Level                       | Professional     |
| :-----------------------------------: |:-------------------------------:| ----------------:|
| Side-Projects                         | Managing Teams of People        | Internship       |
| Learning Useful Languages             |  Improving Interpersonal Skills |                  |
| Learning GitHub and other interfaces  |  Netwroking                     |                  |
## Reasons
### - My first option is easy. Computer science is such a versatile idea. Anyone can learn and create with the internet, and a computer. Keeping this in mind, all that is required to gain experience (albeit this is the lowest level of "professional" experience) is just creating code and software yourself.
### - Any way you can enhance your coding skills is essential. Side projects is the best way in my opinion. 
### - Learn the required languages through school or in your own time through online computer science courses
### - Learn GitHub and other useful interfaces.
### - As for other skills, learning to manage teams of ppeople and even just having good interpersonal skills is great. Learn to network and get good at talking and coordinating with others!
### - An internship is probably the closest you can get to working as an Applications Software Developer without getting an actual job, and can be a great way to learn!
